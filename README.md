# V+V Code Challenge

## DEV OPS

The dev ops configuration for this repository will be ready to go when you clone the project. This includes the config.yml which is what links your local repository to the theme you are working on in your development store. All you should need to run is the following commands and then you are ready to code!
* npm install
* npm run devdeploy
* npm run watch

If you decide to use your own Javascript framework, feel free to add them to using npm.

The password to access your store is `verbalplusvisual`.

## FILE STRUCTURE

The repository has all the templates and logic for a full Shopify build. However, you can ignore most of the templates. For this assignment, please reference the following files.

### /src/templates/collection.liquid
This is where the HTML and Liquid for this page can be updated.
If you are unfamiliar with liquid templating language, please see the documentation here: https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/liquid/reference.
